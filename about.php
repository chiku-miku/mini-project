            Over the course of eight decades, a lot has changed about us. We have relocated, undergone expansion, developed new product lines & added segments, opened retail chains & stores across India and embraced new markets overseas. One thing hasn’t changed - we’re still a tight-knit family business, committed to serving the most authentic taste of India through our products.

            Our origins can be traced back to a small namkeen shop in Bikaner founded by Ganga Bishan Agarwal (Haldiram Ji). This modest shop quickly gained popularity and scaled up to meet a booming demand for its unique-tasting bhujia. Building on this legacy, his grandson, our pioneer Mr. Shiv Kishan Agrawal steered the business towards the heights it has tasted today.

Determined to take bhujia beyond the boundaries of Bikaner, he shifted base to Nagpur in 1970. We opened our first full-production unit to introduce a delectable variety of savouries, sweets and beverages to the market. The success of this venture led us to expand and evolve as a brand, that is an integral part of every Indian household.

            From our formative years, he instilled the value of keeping the tradition and quality intact, even as we matured as a company. All our products maintain a consistent sense of simplicity. The ingredients and recipes were picked to accentuate these ideas and are followed to this date. We promise that all our products are natural, wholesome and have a homemade feel to them.

Although, Haldiram’s is about more than just food. By creating a strong sense of community and supporting our associates, we continue to feel like a true family business. We carry these values with us as we operate together to serve generations of happy connoisseurs across the globe and continue to be the nation’s beloved snack-food company.

As the age old saying goes, “The way to one’s heart courses through their stomach”. We want to leave no stone unturned to win your hearts.
